        Search Form
        ===========
        
        Search Form is a Django application that lets you create very fancy search
        forms in your project. Some of its main features are:
        
          * Easy to use: add, edit and remove search terms with very few clicks and
            keystrokes
          * Easy to integrate: just subclass Search Form and add your search terms
          * Easy to customize: you can change the default search terms, or change
            their layouts with custom templates or maybe change the style using CSS
          * Accesible: it works with no javascript degrading gracefully to a nighties
            version

        Documentation
        =============
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Search Form depends on jQuery 1.2.X so you need to download it and put
        in your media directory. After that you can install search form. Just type::
        
          easy_install searchform
        
        and Easy Install will go to the Cheeseshop and grab the last searchform for
        you. It will also install it for you in your site-packages directory at no
        extra cost :-)
        
        Tutorial
        --------
        
        Using search form is quite simple. Just follow these simple steps:
        
          #. Add 'searchform' to your INSTALLED_APPS tuple in your settings.py. This
             is neccesary so Django can find the default searchform templates.
          #. Add the following url to your urls.py before your regular media url::
        
              (r'^media/searchform/', include('searchform.urls'))
        
        Now, suppose you have this simple model in your application::
        
          class Animal(models.Model):
              name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
              weight = models.CharField(max_length=100)
              max_speed = models.IntegerField()
        
        And you want to make a search form that lets your users find animals in your
        wild database::
        
          from django.utils.datastructures import SortedDict
        
          from searchform.forms import SearchForm
          from searchform.terms import TextSearchTerm
        
          class AnimalSearchForm(SearchForm):
              fields = SortedDict((
                  ('name': TextSearchForm('The name', 'Name', 'which name')),
                  ('weight': TextSearchForm('The weight', 'Weight', 'which weight')),
                  ('max_speed': TextSearchForm('The max speed', 'Speed', 
                                               'which max speed')),
                  ))
        
        Believe it or not that's all the python code you need to write to set up your
        search form. Now it's time to use it in your views::
        
          def advanced_search(request):
              form = AnimalSearchForm('Find animals!', None)
              return render_to_response('your_template.html', {'form': form})
        
        
        Finally let's see how your template looks like::
        
          {% extends "base.html" %}
        
          {% block extrahead %}
            <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}js/jquery-1.2.6.js"></script>
            {{ form.render_media|safe }}
          {% endblock %}
        
          {% block content %}
          <div id="search_form">
        
            <form action="{% url yourapp.views.search_results %}" method="get">
              {{ form }}
            </form>
        
          </div>
          {% endblock %}
        
        Two things worth noting here:
        
          * You need to include jQuery **before** the media of the form
          * The search form must have the id 'search_form'

        terms. Explain what the QueryStringManager is
